# Web-itmo

This is my personal website - a project for my university Web-programming subject (5 semester).
The site is published [here](https://li-o-h.github.io/Web-itmo/).

It contains 6 labs about **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**- you can view the labs [description](https://github.com/Li-O-H/Web-itmo/blob/main/labs/labs.md).
